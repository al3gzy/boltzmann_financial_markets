# Predictive Power of Boltzmann Distribution in Financial Markets  

## Introduction  
The Boltzmann distribution, a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics, has found applications in modeling financial markets. This research challenges traditional financial models like the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and explores how physical principles can improve forecasting accuracy in volatile markets.

## Methodology  
1. **Normalization:** Financial data is transformed into "energy" states using log returns. The transformation helps to stabilize variance across time.

2. **Boltzmann Distribution Modeling:** The price behavior is modeled using the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the probability of an asset price in certain state.

3. **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Asset price paths are simulated based on the Boltzmann distribution, which allows for the prediction of future market behavior.

4. **Correlation Analysis:** We calculate the correlation between the model’s predicted price fluctuations and real market data to evaluate the model’s performance.

## Results  
The Boltzmann distribution model shows a promising fit to actual market fluctuations, with a significant correlation in various asset classes. The results suggest that market behavior, at least to some degree, can be modeled using principles from statistical physics. However, the model has limitations, especially in markets influenced by complex external factors.
