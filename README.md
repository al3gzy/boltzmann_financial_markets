# Predictive Power of Boltzmann Distribution in Financial Markets

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores the application of the **Boltzmann Distribution** from statistical mechanics to model financial markets. By drawing analogies between energy states in physics and asset price fluctuations in economics, the study aims to provide a novel framework for predicting market volatility and trends.

## Key Features
- Application of the **Boltzmann Distribution** to financial modeling.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** for predicting future market conditions.
- Estimation of parameters like market volatility (TF) and market sensitivity (kF).
- Visualization of data, including time series, histograms, and KDE plots.
- Comparison between historical market data and the model's forecasts.

## Model Components
1. **Logarithmic Returns Calculation**: Converts asset price data into 'energy' levels.
2. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: Estimation of the probability density function (PDF) of log returns.
3. **Boltzmann Distribution Adaptation**: Models the probability distribution of market states.
4. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Simulates potential market outcomes based on the Boltzmann framework.

## Results
- A significant correlation between model predictions and historical market data.
- The model offers a promising alternative to traditional financial theories like **Efficient Market Hypothesis** and **Capital Asset Pricing Model**.
